# Experiments:
This directory contains several scripts that launch the different experiments proposed on the paper.
The experiments are stored in the `/data` path as `.json` files.

 * `baseline_comparison.py`: This script launches the experiments for the baseline comparison.
 * `error_distribution.py`: This script launches an experiment to show the error distribution in the segmentation.
 * `heuristic_optimization.py`: This script launches a heuristic (only genetic and pso).
 * `pre-train.py`: This script pre-trains the models with the synthetic database.
 * `transfer.py`: This script launches the transferability experiments.
 * `std_db.py`: This script standardizes the database (subtracting mean and dividing by std. dev.).
 * `representations.ipynb`: It is a jupyter notebook that shows the representations of the experiments.
